1. Two Ways to Apply

There are mainly two ways developers apply for jobs at Turing:

Through an Invite

Sometimes, a Turing Talent Associate will reach out to you directly if your profile matches a role.

If you get an invite, you usually have a 95% chance of being called for an interview, since they already see you as a good fit.

You just need to fill the interest form, complete the tests, and then expect an interview or next step shortly.

Through Their Website

You can also apply directly by browsing open jobs on the Turing website.

In this case, the process is a bit more competitive, as you’re applying along with many other developers.

Whether or not you’re called for an interview depends on your skills, test scores, and how well your profile matches the role.

2. Job Interest Form

Once you decide to move forward (whether invite or website), the first step is to fill out a Job Interest Form.
This form asks about your background, skills, and experience.

3. Tests and Assessments

Next, you’ll be asked to take some technical tests. These often include:

Coding challenges in your main programming language (e.g., Python).

Problem-solving or algorithm tasks.

Sometimes extra tests, depending on the role (databases, system design, etc.).

4. Review Stage

After you submit everything, the Turing team reviews your application and test results.
If you applied through an invite, chances are high you’ll move straight to interviews.
If you applied through the website, they’ll decide based on the match between your profile and the role.

5. Interviews and Matching

If you pass the review, you’ll be called for an interview (usually technical plus a role-fit discussion).
From there, you can get matched to the project or other suitable roles.
